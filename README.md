# Project Happy Thoughts API

Making my own API for an old frontend project, using MongoDB and Mongoose.

## The problem

I didn't have much trouble setting up the API, the difficult part was cleaning up my old frontend repo and implementing it. I ended up reverting the frontend repo to it's original state and just updating the API used.
